## Expectations

### Time commitment
We expect each group member to work on the group project for 4 to 8 hours each week. If a group member cannot finish their assignment after working up to 8 hours, or is expecting to not finish it before the deadline, she should give notice on Slack 24 hours prior to the deadline to see if another group member can help with the task.

### Work quality
We expect all work to meet the requirements detailed in the instructions. Each group member is responsible for making sure the assigned task meets the requirements for that task. This includes but is not limited to making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings
We plan to attend our lab hours virtually. In addition, we will have a regular virtual meeting on Friday 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. every week to update each other on our progress and discuss important issues.
In cases where an additional meeting is required, we will meet if all four of us are able to attend the meeting. If a group member cannot make a regular or an agreed-upon meeting, she is expected to give notice on Slack 8 hours prior to the meeting time.
At the beginning of each meeting, we will spend a few minutes setting the agenda for the meeting.

## Communication
Slack will be the main communication tool and each member is expected to check it regularly. Github will be the primary communication tool for updates on the project, including notes that need to be referred to later as well as other documentations of project progress deemed appropriate.
If a member is expecting to be unreachable through Slack for an extended period of time (8 hours or more),  she is expected to give notice one day prior on Slack so others are aware of the situation.

## Reviews
All members are expected to submit pull requests for their work on the repository and to add other members as reviewers to their work. Reviews are expected to be done in 8 hours after requesting and 24 hours after requesting is the maximum time lag allowed to review the work.

## Roles
Individual assignments will be determined based on 1) individual preference 2) the rotation of different types of work (coding, writing, project management, etc. ).
We have mainly two roles for the group members:
* Submitter:
Responsible for communicating deadlines and expectations on Slack to all team members.
Responsible for submitting the Milestone assignment after proofreading is done.
* Proof-readers:
Everyone else besides the submitter will take up roles as proof-readers.
Responsible for doing a final check of the submission to make sure all requirements are satisfied and informing the submitter that the assignment is ready to be submitted.
Below is the assignment of roles for each week:

Submitter
* Week 1: Shi Yan Wang
* Week 2: Cici Du
* Week 3: Paniz Fazlali
* Week 4: Melisa Maidana


## Deadlines
* Proofread:
Soft deadline is Friday midnight. Hard deadline is Saturday at 10 a.m. This deadline may be adjusted based on reassessment.
* Individual assignments:
The deadlines for individual assignments are set after discussions during Monday lab hours.
* Submission:
We aim to meet the submission deadline of Saturday 12 p.m.

## Breach of Contract
Below are the steps we need to take for any behavior that exhibits signs of breach of contract:
1. Post on Slack, clearly citing what we agreed upon in the contract and tagging the group member who has violated the clause in the contract as a reminder.
2. If the issue persists or the group member does not provide any acknowledgement, the issue will be discussed during the group meetings.
3. If there is still no signs of any improvement, other group members will talk to the TAs or the lab instructor.
