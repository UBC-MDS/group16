## Reflection

### Summary

We achieved the dashboard we planned in week one, including three main plots, a card, and a filter panel. We have received positive feedback on the dashboard structure and length of the data period covered, which provides users better insight through trend analysis. We strived to create the DashR and DashPy app in a way that delivers the same visualization and functionalities.
