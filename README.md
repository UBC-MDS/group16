## Description of the dashboard

The dashboard represents Vancouver crime statistics over the past 5 years. It includes three different graphs and three different input widgets. 

The first graph depicts the bar chart of the counts of different crime types, and the user can specify the neighborhood, year, and time of the day to get different bars. The colors correspond to various kinds of crimes. 

The second graph shows a map of Vancouver with its corresponding number of crimes as circles. The user can specify the year and time of the day for this interactive map. As the number of crimes increases, the size of the circles also increases. The map shows the number of crimes as a tooltip when users hover over different neighborhoods.

The final graph is a time series of crimes. By default, it illustrates the crimes that happened during the day or night over the past 5 years. However, the user can select the time of the day (day or night) from the left panel and update the plot. In addition, the user can specify the years from the left panel and only show the time series of the respective years. Moreover, the user can choose the neighborhood from the left panel and update the time series.

The dashboard also shows the total number of crimes for the user-selected years on the top-left corner.
